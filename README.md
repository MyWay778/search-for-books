## Search for books
Pet-project, book search app.
#### Technology stack
* TypeScript
* React (Hooks)
* Redux (ToolKit)

I made this project as a test task. I tried to use unit-tests (Jest and Testing Library), covered reducer(slice) and a few components. It's good, but I needed to train more with it.
